# MASON

**Multi-agent Automation and Session Orchestration Network.** A Rust daemon
(`masond`) and CLI (`mason`) that run coding agents through a configurable
pipeline of exploring, developing, testing, review and landing, for any number
of projects at once, with SwiftUI and Compose monitors.

Status: **pre-alpha, Stage 10**: pipelines are defined in `.mason/mason.toml`, one scheduler orders every contended resource, test verdicts are proven from output, and a task that needs you asks a short decision card (`mason task answer`) that can be overridden from the CLI (`mason pause`, `mason task skip`, `mason alerts`, `mason metrics`).
